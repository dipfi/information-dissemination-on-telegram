@misc{Garimella.2018,
 abstract = {Echo chambers, i.e., situations where one is exposed only to opinions that agree with their own, are an increasing concern for the political discourse in many democratic countries. This paper studies the phenomenon of political echo chambers on social media. We identify the two components in the phenomenon: the opinion that is shared ('echo'), and the place that allows its exposure ('chamber' --- the social network), and examine closely at how these two components interact. We define a production and consumption measure for social-media users, which captures the political leaning of the content shared and received by them. By comparing the two, we find that Twitter users are, to a large degree, exposed to political opinions that agree with their own. We also find that users who try to bridge the echo chambers, by sharing content with diverse leaning, have to pay a 'price of bipartisanship' in terms of their network centrality and content appreciation. In addition, we study the role of 'gatekeepers', users who consume content with diverse leaning but produce partisan content (with a single-sided leaning), in the formation of echo chambers. Finally, we apply these findings to the task of predicting partisans and gatekeepers from social and content features. While partisan users turn out relatively easy to identify, gatekeepers prove to be more challenging.},

@inproceedings{Jarynowski.2020,
 abstract = {The aim of this study is to quantitatively assess perception of protests around COVID-19 in Germany from the late July till the end of August 2020 in the Internet media by infodemiological approach. To this end we investigate Google searches, Twitter and Telegram posts, and selection of news articles via EventRegistry. We focus on narratives around Berlin Demonstrations on August 1st and August 29th, 2020. Using media intelligence we spot trends, analyze relevant topics over a longer time span and create sociolinguistic landscapes targeting Querdenken and QAnon movements and other actors such as AfD, SPD, and Green political parties and Antifa. Although the dominant actors of the protest are on the far-right political spectrum, we demonstrate (based on network analysis) that left-wing activists could both sympathize with (e.g.~some liberal greens) and oppose (e.g.~Antifa) the protest. Although we observe a constant interest in the protest movements in traditional media, their popularity on social media is growing (for Querdenken faster than for QAnon). The revealed insights shed light on social dynamics in the context of such major disruptive events as COVID-19 pandemic and could serve as a basis for optimization of risk awareness campaigns by the authorities.},
